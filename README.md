The repeat button is epic

## Where to start

<ul>
    <li>Click to color you want to use and then draw <br/></li>
    <li>After drawing click the "Repeat & clear" button to see the program in action <br/></li>
    <li>When the replay is complete, you will be able to clear the canvas <br/></li>
</ul>

## How the program works

<ul>
    <li>It remembers the coordinates of the lines that you draw <br/></li>
    <li>It remembers the lines width that they have <br/></li>
    <li>It remembers the colors you used <br/></li>
    <li>It processes all this data and draw what you have done <br /></li>
</ul>
